              Animals can only do so much to defend themselves from humans with ill will.
              They are like innocent children, limited in their autonomy. Our association evolved from a desire to
              protect these wonderful creatures, and create awareness about the many animal cruelty cases rampant in today's
              society.
              <br><br>
              We began with speaking out about the inhumanity of various zoos and circuses, and have since expanded our efforts
              to include focus on:
              <ul>
                <li>Animal Testing</li>
                <br>
                <li>Species experiencing dwindling population</li>
                <br>
                <li>Unethical farming practices</li>
                <br>
                <li>Collaborations with animal shelters</li>

                <li>Assistance for owners of disabled companions who are unable to meet their pets' care needs</li>

          <h1>Our Origin</h1>
            <p class="subheading1">
              "The four of us knew that a bear riding a bicycle was achieved by unethical means,
              but the question was, how were we going to speak for these animals, who were forced into tasks that they
              are powerless to speak against?" --Shelby Adamson, Original Co-Founder
              <br><br>
              Shelby, Evan, Elena, and Aaron, a group of friends with a goal in mind and the dedication and drive necessary to reach
              for it. They felt the key to change was raising awareness in society about the immorality of common animal entertainment
              practices, and were overjoyed when their movement of humble beginnings gained traction.
            <br>
            <br>
            Originally simply titled an "animal advocacy group", it quickly expanded from a quartet of hopeful, passionate friends handing
            out flyers and staging small protests, to the Animal Advocacy Association as we know it today, a large force to be reckoned with.
            Showing respect and love for all species remains a core value of AAA's, and that is made evident through the educational events,
            peaceful protests, and fundraisers for organizations and shelters sharing similar goals, spearheaded by AAA.
